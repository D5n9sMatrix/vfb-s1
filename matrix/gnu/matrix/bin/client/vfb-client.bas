Chapter 12 provides a brief introduction to software available for com-
putations with linear systems. Some speciÔ¨Åc systems mentioned include the
and R or S-PLUS (or S-Plus ). All of these systems are easy to use, and
the best way to learn them is to begin using them for simple problems. I do
not use any particular software system in the book, but in some exercises, and
particularly in Part III, I do assume the ability to program in either Fortran
or Mathematica . My own preferences for software systems are Fortran and
R, and occasionally, these preferences manifest themselves in the text.
